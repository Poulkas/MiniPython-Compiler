# MiniPython-Compiler

This Mini Python Compiler generate code for the masm32.
The file to analyze must has the name "entrada.txt".
Generate a xml of the code to analyze, the output file is "salida.xml".
The assembly code is at the output file "salida.asm"
In "ProtosAndDefs.h" are the variables names of output files and the file to analyze.
I know is not correct to don't use source file, but I don't remember why I did it like this :'(.
And the code is in spanish.

Thanks
